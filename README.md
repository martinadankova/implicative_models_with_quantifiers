*Implicative Models with Quantifiers: A Fuzzy Set Approach to Interpretable Modeling.*

### üîç Overview

This repository demonstrates the construction of fuzzy implicative models based on functional data, using **fuzzy sets**, **fuzzy quantifiers**, and **linguistic implications**. The goal is to model relationships between input-output pairs using an interpretable fuzzy rule base enhanced by quantifier-driven confidence.

### üìÇ Structure

* `definitions/` ‚Äì Core implementation modules:

  * `FuzzyRelations.py`: fuzzy sets, fuzzy implications, interval functions
  * `quantifiers.py`: linguistic quantifiers and truth evaluation
  * `models.py`: visualization, rule generation, Mamdani and implicative simulation
* `data/funcnihodnoty.xlsx` ‚Äì Input data (two columns: `x` and `fx`)
* `Quantifier_Based_Implicative_Models.ipynb` the main script ‚Äì Construction and visualization of the implicative fuzzy model
* `Quantifiers_Examples.ipynb` - shows examples of implicative quantifier values 
---

### üìà What the Main Script `Quantifier_Based_Implicative_Models` Does

1. **Loads functional data** (`x`, `fx`) from Excel.
2. **Generates fuzzy partitions** on `X` and `Y` domains based on quantifiers.
3. **Builds fuzzy rules** using:

   * Fuzzy intervals (`A·µ¢`, `B·µ¢`) for inputs/outputs
   * Confidence measures via 2√ó2 contingency tables
   * Quantified implications (e.g., $Q(A \Rightarrow B)$)
4. **Visualizes**:

   * Fuzzy sets on `X`, `Y`
   * Rule surfaces
   * Resulting quantified implicative model as fuzzy relation over (X, Y)

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* Libraries:

  ```bash
  pip install numpy pandas matplotlib openpyxl plotly
  ```

---

### üöÄ Running the Model

```bash
python main.py  # or run in a Jupyter notebook
```

Make sure the Excel file `funcnihodnoty.xlsx` is in `data/`.

---

### üß† Example Use Case

This model can be used to:

* Analyze and simulate fuzzy control systems based on human-like rules.
* Construct interpretable regression surfaces from empirical data.
* Compare Mamdani vs implicative rule inference.

---

### üìä Output

* Fuzzy membership functions (A·µ¢ and B·µ¢)
* 2D surface of implication model
* Quantifier confidence values per rule
* Visual comparison of implicative vs Mamdani models
