*Implicative Models with Quantifiers: A Fuzzy Set Approach to Interpretable Modeling.*

### üîç Overview

This repository demonstrates a construction of fuzzy implicative models based on functional data, using **fuzzy sets**, **fuzzy quantifiers**, and **linguistic implications**. The goal is to model relationships between input-output pairs using an interpretable fuzzy rule base enhanced by quantifier-driven confidence.

### üìÇ Structure

* `definitions/` ‚Äì Core implementation modules:

  * `FuzzyRelations.py`: fuzzy sets, fuzzy implications, interval functions
  * `quantifiers.py`: linguistic quantifiers and truth evaluation
  * `models.py`: visualization, rule generation, Mamdani and implicative simulation
* `data/
  * `funcnihodnoty.xlsx` ‚Äì sythetic input data (two columns: `x` and `fx`)
  * `world_bank_indicators.csv` ‚Äì real data gathered by World Bank 
* `Quantifier_Based_Implicative_Models.ipynb` the main script ‚Äì Construction and visualization of the implicative fuzzy model
* `Quantifiers_Examples.ipynb` - shows examples of implicative quantifier values
* `WorldBankExample.ipynb` - provides example of building implicative model with quantifiers for world bank data set together with defuzzification methods and standard simple models
* `WorldBankExample10Rules.ipynb` - the same as above only the number of rules is set to 10
* `ParametersSavingUploading_QuantifiersBasedModels.ipynb` - provides a way how to store the model's parameters and load them for a future manipulations

### üåç Data Source
This project uses synthetic data and may be extended to real-world data such as the World Bank Development Indicators.

Example indicators used in the current code:

* GDP per capita (current US$) 

* Fertility rate, total (births per woman)

### üìà What the Script `Quantifier_Based_Implicative_Models` Does

1. **Loads functional data** (`x`, `fx`) from Excel.
2. **Generates fuzzy partitions** on `X` and `Y` domains.
3. **Builds fuzzy rules** using:

   * Fuzzy intervals (`A·µ¢`, `B·µ¢`) for inputs/outputs
   * Confidence measures via 2√ó2 contingency tables
   * Quantified implications (e.g., $Q(A \Rightarrow B)$)
4. **Visualizes**:

   * Fuzzy sets on `X`, `Y`
   * Rule surfaces
   * Resulting quantified implicative model as fuzzy relation over (X, Y)

### üìà What the Script `WorldBankExample` Does

1. **Loads the data** (`GDP per capita (current US$)`, `Fertility rate, total (births per woman)`) from csv.
2. **Generates fuzzy partitions** on `X` and `Y` domains.
3. **Builds fuzzy rules** using:

   * Fuzzy intervals (`A·µ¢`, `B·µ¢`) for inputs/outputs
   * Confidence measures via 2√ó2 contingency tables
   * Quantified implications (e.g., $Q(A \Rightarrow B)$)
4. **Visualizes**:

   * Fuzzy sets on `X`, `Y`
   * Rule surfaces
   * Resulting quantified implicative model as fuzzy relation over (X, Y)
   * Various defuzzification methods with visualisations together over the original data as well as the quantified implicative model

### ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* Libraries:

  ```bash
  pip install numpy pandas matplotlib openpyxl plotly
  ```

---

### üöÄ Running the Model

```bash
python main.py  # or run in a Jupyter notebook
```

Make sure the Excel file `funcnihodnoty.xlsx` is in `data/`.

### üß† Example Use Case

This model can be used to:

* Analyze and simulate fuzzy control systems based on human-like rules.
* Construct interpretable regression surfaces from empirical data.
* Compare Mamdani vs implicative rule inference.

---

### üìä Output

* Fuzzy membership functions (A·µ¢ and B·µ¢)
* 2D surface of implication model
* Quantifier confidence values per rule
* Visual comparison of implicative vs Mamdani models
